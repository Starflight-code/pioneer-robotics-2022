# Pioneer Robotics 2022
This repository contains the code for the Pioneer Robotics 2022-2023 Vex Robots. ~~Have a problem or feature you'd like us to add? Open an issue, we'll look over it closely once we've recieved it and our team will solve it soon after.~~

We've wrapped up this year of Vex Robotics. We'd like to thank everyone who competed with us. We're already looking towards the next year. This repository will no longer receive feature updates and is no longer maintained. Reach out to our team for more information on any changes or programming policy updates in the upcomming years. Thank you for your interest in and support for our mission.
